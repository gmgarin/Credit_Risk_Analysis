# Credit_Risk_Analysis
### Machine Learning Analytics Using LedingClub Dataset

## Overview of the analysis:

### This analysis involved the application of supervised machine learning algorithms, specifically in the area of credit risk analysis. Different techniques were employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. *imbalance-learn* and *scikit-learn* libraries were also utilized to build and evaluate models using resampling. The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from LendingClub.

## Results:
